            My name is Arek Chwedczuk
            I'm currently living in Wroc≈Çaw. 
            3 years ago I had to learn BATCH for classes.
            I liked it. Really.
            Now I'm still learning programming.
            I hope it will be even more useful than BATCH.
            I'm focusing on JS now and a bit on front-end works.
            I love creating - that's why I program.
            I like doing by job well - sometimes it takes hours of my life.
          
          </div>
          <ScrollHint/>
          <div className='about-p '>
            I'm opened for any propositions. 
            My lack of any commercial experience was caused by my school.
            Now I'm external student, so... 
            <div className='about-m'>
              I'm here! 
              I want get my first experience,
              and not to disappoint anyone, including me.
